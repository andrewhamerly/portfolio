# Portfolio

## Description

This project was developed with the idea of pushing the limits of my own creativity. As a designer turned developer, I felt the desire to create a professional portfolio with some of my latest projects in a fashion that would highlight my latest added skills. This application provides a window into what a mixture of minimal design practices coupled with modern CSS can provide for responsive portfolio sites.

## Installation
